Playing with Scala parsers:
        an implementation of an indentation-based syntax for HTML

Principle:
define <tag attributes>contents</tag> with syntaxes:

- tag<attributes>:

then, the contents of the tag will be the rest of the line, and the next lines
until their indentation is equal or less than that of the tag.

- or tag<attributes>{ contents }

with explicit, possibly multi-line, contents


You can also use {{verbatim contents}}


This is nothing serious really :)


NB: I have seen that the web framework for Haskell Yesod has a syntax for HTML
called Hamlet that has some simiarities with this (but it's of course much, much
more). If you're interested in something more serious check out
